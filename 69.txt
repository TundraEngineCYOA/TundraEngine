|	Slowly you enter the cemetary and carefully look over the many
|	gravemarkers. Though you can't read a single letter carved onto
|	the stone markers. You feel the pain of those who lost loved one's.
|	But you think to yourself how strange that this cemetary is clean
|	and well maintaned. Just who do this? Perhaps it's the Old Man, but
|	still it's honestly a mighty task. Before you know it, you reach a
|	set of stairs.

|	1. Climb the stairs.
|	2. Leave the Cemetary.
