|	Figuring it would be best in searching another room within this place,
|	slowly enter what appears to be a place in storing the dead. You feel
|	a bit sick at this sight and give a moment of silence to those who've
|	lost their lives.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Search the dead.
|	2. Leave this place of death.
