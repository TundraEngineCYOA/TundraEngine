|	Without giving it a second thought you quickly follow the strange
|	being. Trying not to make a sound but failing every so often. A
|	strange cry can be heard carrying through the air. As you pass
|	by the empty ruins of once filled buildings. But within a matter
|	of a few seconds you lost track of the strange being. And within
|	a few moments a candle flickers from the second floor. Almost as 
|	if your being led to your certain doom. 

|	What do you do?

|	1. Enter the building.
|	2. Wait outside.
