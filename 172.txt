|	My name is Ava. She says as she lets out a quite sigh.

|	What?

|	I'm just tired of this, not at you, just tired of what happened.
|	She says, as she looks up to the ceiling. 

|	It's going to get better, once we reach the Speakerm we'll get.
|	the answers we need and hopefully we can rebuid. Now, I'm not
|	from around here, but I'm too far deep into this now and can't
|	just leave. You say with a chuckle.

|	That's if we can get to them first. She says with a grin as she
|	reaches for a small bottle from in her pocket and twists off the
|	lid and takes a sip. 

|	What's that?

|	Alcohol, made out of the Lycaster plant. It's made for ceremonys
|	and celebrations of life. She says, as she reaches over and hands
|	the bottle.

|	Taking the bottle, you figure what's the worse that can happen and
|	without a second thought, you take a swig and swollow it down. It's
|	honestly not that bad...taste like cherry.

|	1. Tell me about yourself?
