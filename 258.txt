|	What is the Great Walk?

|	It's what those who don't have anything left in life to do. It's
|	a journey that has been taken by all those that reach a certain
|	age. It is to reflect the life that we have spent on this Earth.

|	So it's a death march? You ask.

|	It's a celebration of one's life. You start from the place you call
|	home and travel to the Great Peak. Where God will greet you into
|	the Kingdom of the Sun. They say with great excitement.

|	What do you do?

|	1. How old are you?
|	2. Does everyone do this?
|	3. Where is the Great Peak?
