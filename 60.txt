|	Deciding it would be nice to have a quick rest you sit on the old
|	stone bench. It's a nice moment of rest that really gives you that
|	sense of wonder. Knowing that you are taking in the atmosphere of 
|	this once untouched piece of history. The landscape is covered in
|	stone buildings that give off the feeling of a haunted world. Where
|	the dead come to life.
