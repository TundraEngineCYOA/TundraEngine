|	You decide to keep moving and soon you find yourself wandering a
|	massive ballroom but the looks of it. A beautiful open floor...
|	looking like marble...with stone pillars and candles hanging off
|	the walls. Portraits of those who came before and have long since
|	passed on.
|	everyone in their paths. As someone stands on a pillar with their
|	hands up to the heavens...most likely the Speaker.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Examine the portraits.
|	2. Blow out the candles.
|	3. Take in the view.
|	4. Look around the Ballroom.
