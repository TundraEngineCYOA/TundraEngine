|	Sorry, I didn't mean to bother you. You said.

|	No...no...you didn't bother me. It's just strange to hear from another soul
|	not from this land. It gets lonely here at times. Everything is a fight and
|	it truly breaks the spirit...I'm just tired is all...tired of this damned
|	place.

|	What happened here? You ask, you can feel your curiosity growing.

|	Madness happened. The greed of power, the wanting it, and turning their backs
|	on those in need. I have seen it...I have seen it all...the deaths. The pools
|	of blood, the feasting on the flesh of the recently killed, and I have turned
|	mad cause of it. 

|	You begin to wonder if what this odd person says is true? It would answer
|	why this place is scarce of people or perhaps why everything looks to have
|	been recently abandoned.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Is that why everyone's gone?
|	2. Tell me of the Speaker.
