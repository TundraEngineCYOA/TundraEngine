|	The two of you quickly run and take cover behind a wooden fence.
|	Not knowing what to expect you check your surroundings and see
|	vacant ruins of abandoned homes. And before you can even say a
|	word you are dragged into the small opening of what appears to
|	be a small storage area holding supplies like grain.

|	I think we'll be safe here. 

|	What was that? You ask.

|	A Hunter, the lowest of the low forms of life here.

|	You know, since we've meet I've never learned your name. You say
|	with a grin.

|	You don't need to know that yet.

|	A silence grows after she says this to you and that you think to
|	yourself how that's the perfect thing to say while on the brink
|	of life and death.

|	1. Wait.
