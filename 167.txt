|	Leaving the area, you find yourself standing before a small child, 
|	wearing clothes that are three sizes to big for him, and a moment
|	passes by as he points to someone off into the shadows, and just
|	as you turn you see a six foot tall grizzly looking man wearing a
|	an old and weathered white robe.
