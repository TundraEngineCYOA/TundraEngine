|	It came with the dawn and soon it took the lives of everyone. A stranger
|	who we have never seen before walked into our world and within about a
|	few days time. People were getting sick and within a short span of time
|	our mighty numbers dropped by half. Fear over took the minds of those
|	remaining and soon neighbour turned on neighbour and family against
|	family. Soon the streets were stained by the blood of the innocent.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Who was the Stranger?
|	2. Are you here alone?
