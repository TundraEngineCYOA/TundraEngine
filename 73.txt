|	Slowly, you take your time and climb the staircase. Your mind is
|	filled with thoughts of fear. Not knowing just what or whom you'll
|	see. A cool breeze brushes past you and you don't feel alone. You
|	Are standing before a large memorial, carved to resemble that of a
|	monolith, and it towers over you with such a presenses that you are
|	taken a back from it.
