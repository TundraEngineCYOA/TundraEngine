|	You are amazed by the vast entrance to the Temple. Large stone
|	statues tower over you, with arms raised to the sky and in the
|	center of the entrance is a large carved sun. Columns carved to
|	resemble that of snakes stretch in such a way that you are truly
|	amazed by it. It's almost something from another world. Walking
|	around the entrance you find many amazing things from statues, to
|	carvings, and ever fountains that seem to be still functional. 
|	A large staircase leads to the second floor to what is anyone's
|	guess.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Examine the Statues.
|	2. Examine the Carvings.
|	3. Examine the Fountains
|	4. Go to the second floor.
