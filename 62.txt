|	Walking through the aisles of the once busy store honestly takes
|	you back to your own experiences in dealing with everyday life. It's
|	funny with how similair that life is no matter with what place in 
|	the world you are. Something catches your eye...a flickering candle
|	light that dances in the backroom.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Search the back.
|	2. Leave the store
