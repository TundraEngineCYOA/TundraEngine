|	You must've seen some great things.

|	Oh yes, I've seen many great things in my younger days. I've
|	visited many villages outside of my own. I've meet some interesting
|	people and learned some pretty good lessons that no one could
|	ever teach. Seen many types of animals not recorded and even seen
|	what lurkes outside of the barrier.

|	What do you do?

|	1. How many villages are here?
|	2. What animals?
|	3. Where is the barrier?
|	4. Got any advice for me?
