|	Tell me of the dark times? Is that where most of the people went?

|	Most of them but not all of them. Many others fled to the other provinces
|	and the majority of them were killed out of fear of spreading the disease.
|	Some went to the surface and were never heard from again and I like to
|	think some of them survived and found peace.

|	How many other provinces are there?

|	Roughly seven if you follow the old maps and books. But I'm not sure about
|	if their still alive or not. No one knows. Many have sent messages and are
|	never replied too. If I was younger, I would venture over the wall and see
|	just what happened to them. 

|	What do you do?

|	1. Do they too have Speakers?
|	2. Is there a way to go over the wall?
|	3. Does every province have a Speaker?
