|	Making your way into the home, you find that it's rather small consisting
|	of a few rooms, and as you slowly enter the kitchen. Laying on the floor
|	is the remains of the pot and then in the next room you hear footsteps. A
|	chill runs down your spine.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Call out to whoever's there.
|	2. Enter the other room.
