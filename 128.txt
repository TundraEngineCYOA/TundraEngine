|	Hello? You call out and recieve nothing as a response. 

|	Nothings moving...nothing at all. A few moments pass as the cries of a
|	woman fills the air. A chill runs down your spine. Fear takes hold of
|	your soul and soon you begin to wonder just why your here?

|	What do you do?

|	1. Leave this place.
|	2. Follow the crying.
