|	You are standing at a vast area, carved out of the Earth, as torches give off
|	much light revealing a large stone statue of a forgotten God or perhaps a king?
|	There are many stone benches placed around the statue most likely to pray too.
|	A large alter used to give gifts rests at it's feet. Behind the statue is a
|	large entranceway leading to an unknown place.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Examine the Statue.
|	2. Search the alter.
|	3. Venture into the unknown.
