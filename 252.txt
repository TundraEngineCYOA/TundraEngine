|	You decide now would be a good time to sit down by this peaceful
|	river and take sometime to relax. As the grass around you dances
|	in the wind, as the Sun shines it makes you feel truly comfortable.
|	The feeling of peace washes over you and the sound of the running
|	water gives you a sense of inner peace.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Watch the water.
|	2. Look up to the sky.
