|	The Monolith is carved from stone, perfectly created as if done by
|	machine. Names who's pronounciation you don't where to start with.
|	But if you had to make a guess, you'd have to say it was keeping the
|	memory of those who gave their lives fighting. But that's only just
|	a guess though.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Touch the monolith.
