|	Entering the store room you are greeted by a lit candle placed on
|	the top of a bottle. It rests on the center of the table. Who lit
|	it? Just as quickly search the small room, you find that you are
|	alone and suddenly the wind picks up and the blanket hanging on the
|	wall is moving a bit. You pull it back and reveal a small door that
|	leads into a backalley. Whatever is going on your not alone...that's
|	for sure. 

|	What do you do?

|	1. Go to the Alley.
|	2. Return to the Store.
