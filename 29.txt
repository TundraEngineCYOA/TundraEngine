|	As you reach the end of the tunnel, you find yourself standing before a vast
|	room. Littered with broken statues of forgotten warriors and Gods. The place
|	is overgrown with weeds and moss. In the distance you can hear the cries of
|	a bird or what you hope is a bird.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Explore the area.
|	2. Examine the broken statues.
