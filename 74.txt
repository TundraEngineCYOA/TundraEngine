|	The Temple calls out to and soon you find yourself walking towards
|	the mighty tower that almost can touch the sky. Built with a large
|	Sun hanging over the large twelve foot tall doors. It's something
|	out of science fiction. Everything is perfectly built and has been
|	remained clean since society has vanished.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Enter the Temple.
|	2. Take a moment to think.
