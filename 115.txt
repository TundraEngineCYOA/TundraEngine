|	You walk down a large hallway and soon find yourself standing before
|	a great hall. White walls with golden columns more fit for a King then
|	for a Temple. Sconces hang off the walls giving off an eerie light in  
|	the hall. Someone's here, they have to be here! You think to yourself.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Walk through the Hall.
|	2. Take a moment.
