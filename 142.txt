|	Roaming around the area, you find a world left forzen in time. Everyday
|	items, stuff you wouldn't just leave behind for a long period of time.
|	Though this time something doesn't feel right...something feels off and
|	within a minute you hear movement coming from beneath the floor. 

|	1. Call out to who's beneath you.
|	2. Stomp on the floor.
