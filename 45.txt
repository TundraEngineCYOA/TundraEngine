|	Many creatures lurke in the darkness, many spirits roam the many roads,
|	and rooms. Echoes of the past always have a way of returning to what they
|	use to do.
|
|	Is there anyway I can protect myself from them? You ask.
|
|	Do not disturb any of the items you come across. Do not disrespect this
|	sacred place. For this is the final resting place for my people.

|	What do you do?

|	1. What happened to your people?
|	2. Are you here alone?
