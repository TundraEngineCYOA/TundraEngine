|	You keep moving in the hopes of finding out the source of the groans. Slowly,
|	make your around the area, turning corners, and so the noises get louder.
|	They remind you of someone dying...or a pig being slaughtered. A foul smell
|	is carried in the air and soon you find yourself standing before a large door.
|	The groans can be heard and the source is whatever awaits you behind this door.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Keep listening.
|	2. Slowly open the door.
|	3. Leave.
