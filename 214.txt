|	I've lived her my entire life. I recall the beginning of the end
|	of all that was built. The madness that infected the lives of
|	everyone, the sickness that came from the outside, and how it all
|	came down to this. My parents were taken by the Council and the
|	last time I ever saw them again. There was a time when life was
|	perfect, there was a time when you could live without fear, and
|	here I am...living in the shadows with the other poor souls.
|	Hiding from those who have been consumed by complete darkness
|	who will do anything to take from those who have nothing. That's
|	my life in a nutshell. She says as she takes a heavy drink.
