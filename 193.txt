|	Educate? In what sense?

|	By showing you the light of our God. By taking you to the Speaker.

|	The Speaker? You ask, wondering just what will happen if you say yes.
|	It's honestly something that does intrigue you.

|	What do you do?

|	1. I would like to meet the Speaker.
|	2. No thank you.
