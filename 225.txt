|	The tablet is made out of a very fine stone with a golden boarder.
|	Carved into the stone appears to be the birth and death of this
|	Warrior. As you turn around to leave, you hear the faint sound of
|	people talking in the distance. Following the sound of their voices
|	you walk through a small group of bushes and kneel down hoping to
|	hear what's being said.

|	1. Listen to the talking.
