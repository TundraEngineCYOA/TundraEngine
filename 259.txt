|	What happened here?

|	Many thing have brought this upon us. I like to think it's the
|	fools from up above who let this all happen. They just don't
|	think we're not smart enough to realize it is all.

|	I've heard it was a stranger from the outside that brought it
|	upon the people. You said.

|	That is what they say, but I know better, I know exactly what
|	was the cause of it.

|	What? You ask intrigued.

|	It was the Speaker, thinking that they could garner more support
|	from us so they would seem useful to us.

|	What do you do?

|	1. So you think it's all a lie?
|	2. What happened to the Speaker?
