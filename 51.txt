|	Who was the stranger? You ask.
|
|	The stranger arrived after the festival of the Sun. He came from the
|	other side. Not much was known of him, but he said no word, and just
|	as he arrived he was gone. Some say he was God who came to curse us.
|	God put a curse on this place, poisoned the land, and left nothing
|	but a tombstone. Now, before it gets too late, you should venture out
|	before my time here is up.
|	
|	What do you do?

|	1. Leave the home?
