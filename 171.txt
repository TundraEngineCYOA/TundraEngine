|	Making your way to the door without making a sound, you build up the
|	nerves to lookout at the source of the voices. Taking a moment to
|	make your move. She puts her hand on your shoulder trying to stop you
|	from getting caught. But as you pierce from the opening of the door
|	you see a roaming horde of of masked people.

|	They have to be here? One of them says.

|	You said they were here...then where are they? Another says in an
|	angry tone.

|	Silence fills the air and you can hear your heart beat like a jackhammer
|	pounding through your chest. At any moment you can be spotted and killed.
|	or worse. 

|	1. Keep listening.
|	2. Move away from the door.
