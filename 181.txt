|	The last time I checked the Speaker was in the Temple. Surrounded by
|	those who worship them and wish to be protected by the outside world.

|	How many you figure are up there? You ask.

|	I honestly don't know. But what I do know is that they'll fight to
|	the very end.

|	What do you do?
