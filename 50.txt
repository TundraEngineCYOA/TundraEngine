|	What were the dark times? You ask.
|
|	It was a time when people were dying, those who weren't sick rose
|	against those in authority. Soon, as the dead were littering the
|	streets and the smell was so powerful that even the gardens could
|	not bring relief. They stormed the Temple and soon the Speakers 
|	were left to the crowd and in the end God wasn't there for them.
|	And within a short period of time all those within this place were
|	gone.
