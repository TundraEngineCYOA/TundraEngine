|	You walk along the path just wondering what sites await you. Perhaps
|	you might see any form of life other than a plant? Or maybe some great
|	treasure? Your mind begin's racing with the possibilites. And soon you
|	find yourself standing before a small dwelling. Built out of stone with
|	a flickering light. Perhaps someone's home?

|	What do you do?

|	1. Enter the home.
|	2. Keep walking.
