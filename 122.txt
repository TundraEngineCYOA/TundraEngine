|	As the two of you slowly walk down the bare street, void of any life,
|	as you look around the main life line of this world. It is honestly
|	unnerving in a way.

|	How long have you been alone? She asks.

|	It may look like I'm alone but I'm not. I'm surrounded by the spirits
|	and they never leave me alone. She says with a hint of sadness in her
|	voice.

|	How many are left here? You ask, not wanting to upset her.

|	By my count there's about a few dozen. Many went to the surface and were
|	never heard from again. I think their dead. But those who stayed live in
|	the shadows, hiding from the Hunters, and try to find a way of returning
|	life to the way it was. 

|	Is that why your here?

|	Yeah. She says in a heavy sigh.

|	You stand before a small building and most likely a storage building of some
|	sort.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Enter the building.
