|	Looking out the window, you look over what must've been a wonderful view
|	before this all went to hell. A vast sea of empty homes and it honestly
|	makes you miss the world your from. Just as your about to leave, you see
|	a few fires being started, and it makes you feel a sense of hope. Maybe
|	there are others out there who are fighting for the better?

|	What do you do?

|	1. Keep moving.
