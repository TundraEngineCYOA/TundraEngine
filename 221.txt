|	There are others outside the wall? You ask intrigued to hear that.

|	There are others outside of this place, other villages, and other
|	Speakers. The wall was built to contain us all from spreading death
|	to others. Those who tried to flee were killed but that was many
|	years ago. I don't even know if anyones even still alive anymore.

|	What do you do?

|	1. How do we pass the wall?
|	2. Let's find out if they'll kill us.
|	3. What do you want to do?
