|	Hello, where are you?

|	The groaning grows louder and shortly after that you see something
|	begin to move. A hand shoots out from the pile of bodies as if they
|	have been hiding.

|	Are you okay? You ask, as you frantically make your way to them.

|	You climb the pile of bodies and start digging to help the unknown
|	lost soul within this world of madness. As you start to pull them
|	up they start moving until they break through. Out of breath you
|	fall back and look to the person you struggled to help. It's a
|	young woman who appears to be in her mid-twenties with long black
|	hair. She looks tired and completely out of it.

|	What do you do?

|	1. How long have you been there?
|	2. Are you okay?
|	3. What happened to you?
