|	Where is everyone? You ask. Fearful of the outcome with this stranger.

|	Overtime they've been taken away...lead to the slaughter to feed the hunger
|	of the damned. One by one they were taken away. If they damned illness
|	hadn't taken ahold of us, then they wouldn't have gotten away with it. But
|	if that was the case then none of this would've happened. If God was real
|	of course...God is dead and so are all of us.

|	What do you do?

|	1. What do you mean to feed?
|	2. How did God die?
