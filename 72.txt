|	You slowly wander around the first floor of the building and make
|	a horrific discovery. Being that oh piles of bodies covered with  
|	blankets to give the dead a final shred of dignity. There's no
|	telling how long they've been here, but it's best not to stick
|	around.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Search another room.
|	2. Find a way to the second floor.
