|	Exploring the area, you are finding a very dark and unknown world.
|	Wandering around, you find many cells occupied with the Earthly
|	remains of those poor souls left to die in the darkness. A foul
|	stench fills the air as the sound of dripping water echoes through
|	the place. As you walk around you see someone or something sitting
|	in a chair perfectly still in the shadows.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Walk to the figure.
|	2. Talk to the figure.
|	3. Continue walking.
