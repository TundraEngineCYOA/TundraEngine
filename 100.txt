|	How have you been able to survive for so long? You ask.
|
|	I've been leaving traps to catch whatever I can and gathering what vegetables
|	and herbs I can find. 

|	You've also been jumping around like a crazy person too I assume? You ask.

|	No, that must've been a Hunter. They've been lurking around her a lot lately.
|	If you see one going one way do yourself a favor and go the other. They will
|	only attack if they either see you or are hungry.

|	Good to know, thanks.

|	So what brings you down here? It just can't be for the sights.

|	I'm an explorer of sorts, just trying to find what no one else has and I think
|	I found.

|	Well, don't let me slow you down. She says.

|	1. Would you like to join my Adventure?
|	2. Thank her for her time and leave.
