|	The artwork is truly impressive. They tell the story of how their
|	God has created the world by means of creating everything out of
|	wood. By the act of carving the world, the animals, tree's, and
|	the people. Told by the blankets that were said to be a gift to
|	keep them warm. So blankets are the canvas that hold their stories.
|	That's just my thoughts on the subject but it would make sense if
|	that was the case. Though the images are up for interpatation to
|	say the least.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Take the Artwork.
|	2. Search the place.
