|	Tell me of the Speaker? You ask, wanting to understand everything about
|	them.

|	It is rumoured that the Speaker died from the diease of the air. But it is
|	not known for sure. Though, many have not seen or heard from the Speaker
|	in years.

|	What do you do?

|	1. What will happen is the Speaker is dead?
|	2. Who will replace the Speaker if dead?
|	3. Can the Speaker be killed?
|	4. Will the light return if the Temple is no more?
