|	Valley of the Unknown
|
|	Act I
|
|	You are standing before a vast valley carved deep within the Earth by eons 
|	of erosion. The ground is covered in a fine mixture of grass and wheat. A
|	gentle breeze cuts through the area giving you a sense of peace and relaxation.
|	In the distance stands an old stone church built by those from a forgotten
|	time. What lurkes within this unknown charted place is anyone's guest, but your
|	going to be the one who finds out. 


|	What do you do?

|	1. Travel through valley.
|	2. Head to the Church.
