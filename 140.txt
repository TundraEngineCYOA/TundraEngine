|	As the two of you slowly walk down the bare street, void of any life,
|	as you look around the main life line of this world. It is honestly
|	unnerving in a way.

|	How long have you been alone? She asks.

|	The two of you enter the building in the hopes of finding a place to
|	hide until that...thing leaves. The two of you sit across from each
|	other. Silence fills the place as the cries of that fowl creature can
|	be heard. 

|	*Whispering* Do you think it knows where we are? You ask.

|	She shakes her head and slowly to the doorway. With not even blinking
|	for a minute, she turns to you and says.

|	*Whispering* Knowing our luck it's toying with us. But I don't think
|	that's going to happen to us...not yet.

|	*Whispering* What is that thing? You ask.

|	*Whispering* After the collapse of normal life, many began to believe in
|	the old ways, back before the Speaker changed everything. The belief of
|	offering human lives, eating them, and believing that they are God's them-
|	selves. After a few years they began to change, they began to believe they
|	were the true rulers of this place. The killings and eating of people has
|	driven them mad. Before you arrived they were everywhere, but lately there
|	have been a lot less of them around.

|	*whispering* Are they still alove?

|	*Whispering* Who?

|	*Whispering* The Speaker?

|	*Whispering* No one knows. Some say the Speaker ascended to the sky and others
|	others think they are controlling the chaos.

|	Before she could finish, a groan can be heard what sounds ike it's just a 
|	few yards away. The two of you both look to the door and waiting in an
|	eerie silence.

|	1. Wait in silence.
|	2. Lookout the door.
