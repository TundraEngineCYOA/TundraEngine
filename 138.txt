|	A pile of clothes that could clothe a small village. Just why is there 
|	a pile of clothes here? Who's collecting them and how were they taken?
|	Something doesn't feel right here, something unnatural in a way happened
|	here. Slowly, you look through the piles of clothes that look to be 
|	nothing but rags. Old clothes crafted generations ago, just by how they
|	look compared to what you think they'd wear. Perhaps this was a tailors
|	shop or a laundromat?

|	What do you do?
