|	Walking towards the village, a large wooden fence divides them from
|	the outside world. You walk past the large gate and find yourself
|	looking at wood homes and a few places where the public are gathered.
|	As a few people look upon you with suspicion. 

|	Greetings newcomer, come in, come in. A friendly voice calls out to you
|	from a small crowd of on lookers.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Check your surroundings.
|	2. Greet the mystery person.
