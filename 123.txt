|	As the two of you walk down the street your companion stops in her
|	tracks. She scans the area and just as your about to say something
|	she hushes you. She signals you to head down the alley and quickly
|	the two move to the alley. She quickly pushes you against a wall.
|	Before you can say a word she presses her hand against your mouth.
|	A few moments pass as in the distance you see a short pudgy figure
|	walk silently. Their appearance is sickly and they seem as if they
|	aren't even there. She quickly removes her hand and signs for you
|	two to keep moving until you find a place to lay low for awhile.

|	1. Keep moving.
