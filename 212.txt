|	It's a lost world of sorts. Everything is lost within time and it's
|	enough to drive confusion into the strongest of minds. You feel a
|	strange pressence around you and as the day goes on, you are starting
|	to feel drained, and you would really like to take a moment to rest.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Find a place to rest.
