|	Walking past the window and making your way to God knows where. As you
|	keep climbing you notice the temperature is rising ever so slowly and
|	soon you come to an old wooden door. That seems out of place with how
|	the rest of the place looks.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Knock on the door.
|	2. Press your ear to the door.
|	3. Open the door.
