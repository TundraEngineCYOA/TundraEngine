|	I'm an Exporer, looking for a lost city within the Earth. A fabled
|	world which was believed to never exist. But I've found it and I'm
|	here to document it and understand just what happened here. You say
|	with confidence.

|	An Explorer? From the surface? The Leader of the group responds.

|	Yes, two different worlds.

|	What's the surface like?

|	Nothing like this, that's for sure.

|	1. So, what's going to happen to me?
|	2. Are you Hunters?
|	3. Who are you people?
