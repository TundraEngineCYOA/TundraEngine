|	You look around the strange and yet clean room. It looks to be a lot
|	cleaner then the others that you've seen that were storing the dead.
|	Diagrams of the human body hang from the walls with lamps hanging from
|	the ceiling. A wooden table is placed in the center of the room. 

|	What do you do?

|	1. Examine the diagrams.
|	2. Examine the table.
|	3. Search the room.
