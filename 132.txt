|	Taking a moment, you sit down at the table and look over the massive
|	size of the room. You think about just who sat around this table, the
|	feasts, the celebrations over a good meal, and as you sit in complete
|	silence you hear a knock at the door from the otherside of the room.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Come in.
|	2. Stay perfectly silent.
