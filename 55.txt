|	You wander down the street in the hopes of finding someone or some
|	sign of life or perhaps something of value. Stopping for a moment
|	you find yourself standing at a crossroads within this maze of
|	buildings. Many with signs in a language you yet know nothing about.
|	But it could either be a market or a residentual area only one way
|	to findout for sure. But just as you are about to decide the sound
|	of a horn can be heard from behind you. Your mind starts to wonder
|	if it's either the Old Man or perhaps someone else. But you should
|	go and check it out.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Investigate the sound.
