|	You make your way to the old dusty single pane glass window and attempt
|	to look through it. In the hopes of finding another soul or perhaps a 
|	sign of human occupation. But all you see is nothing it's too dark to see 
|	if anyone or thing is there.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Open the window.
|	2. Head to the door.
