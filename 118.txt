|	You make your way towards the small stack of books whose titles you 
|	can't read. You slowly flip through the books and find many with
|	pictures of cave systems and of mountains. This must be a history book  
|	you think or perhaps what awaits you within this hidden world.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Leave the room.
|	2. Go to bed.
