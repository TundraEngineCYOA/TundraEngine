|	Without making a sound you move closer to the strange being...you
|	look at it's face and you see that it's eye's are completely bandaged
|	up. Standing perfectly stil you can hear it speak.

|	The light gives the life to those in the shadows. The Speaker promised
|	me sight...the Speaker took my eye's cause I disobeyed...I am...good.

|	Suddenly the being stops and begin's to smell the air around him...he
|	senses you, you think to yourself.

|	Where are you? Who are you?...You do not smell like anyone in the Speakers
|	court...reveal yourself.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Reveal yourself.
|	2. Keep moving.
|	3. Ask him about his eyes.
|	4. Watch him.
