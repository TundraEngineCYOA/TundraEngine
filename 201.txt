|	While you walk around the area, you find more and more bodies stacked
|	to the ceiling. This is madness, nothing but death, and chaos. Something
|	isn't right here and you are starting to wonder just what is happening
|	within this place is complete insanity. Just then you come into a room,
|	a room that looks like a surgery room.
