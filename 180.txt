|	The fear of leaving everything I know, the world that I know, and I
|	want to be here for when the light returns and rebuilds our home as
|	it was before the dark times.

|	But aren't you curious to see what lyes outside of here? You ask.

|	I do...but knowing that others have gone before me and never returned.
|	It's something that I'm afraid of witnessing. Maybe, I will once
|	everything has calmed down and the Sun returns. I would like to see
|	your world someday.

|	What do you do?

|	1. What do you like to eat?
