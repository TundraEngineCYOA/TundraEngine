|	You manage to reach a small street and figure it would be best if you
|	stuck to the alleys. Never know just who or what you may find wandering
|	about. In within a short period of time you hear the sound of a horrific
|	yell coming from behind you. Without a second to spare you run until you
|	reach what appears to be a home or you think it's a home. You decide it
|	would be for the best if were to lay low for awhile until whatever that
|	was is long gone. So without a moment to spare you quickly enter the
|	place and croutch down, hiding in the shadows, silently, waiting.

|	1. Search the place.
|	2. Lookout the window.
