|	Exploring the area you've found yourself spending hours looking at the 
|	perfectly carved statues. Almost as if they have been made by modern
|	machines. It fills your heart with excitement. Several of them wearing
|	armor that looks almost from the middle ages. Just who were these 
|	people? What was their history? Are their any more of them still around?

|	What do you do?

|	1. Search the ruins.
|	2. Take in the scenery.
