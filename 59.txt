|	The sound echos through the empty streets like a child crying in
|	the night. Soon you find that you are standing outside the home of
|	the Old Man. Wondering just what is happening, you rush in, and find
|	him sitting by his fire with a horn is in his hand. He greets you
|	with a warm smile and tells you to sit.

|	I wanted to speak with you again, but didn't know how to get your
|	attention. So I figured why not use the old battle horn. I wanted to
|	let you know that if I have important things to say. 
|
|	Like what? You ask.
|
|	I know you are getting tempted and drawn into touching or wanting to
|	take something as a reminder of your time here. But don't, the spirits
|	will not like that, and they will do what they can to stop you. Now,
|	you can go back to your adventure. Oh, and before I forget. If you
|	enter the Temple, don't sit on the Throne of the Gods.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Leave.
