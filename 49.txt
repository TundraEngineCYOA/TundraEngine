|	Tell me of the Speaker. You ask.
|
|	It was believed that those who ruled over this land, this place we
|	call home. They have a place to where God can speak with them and then
|	they speak to us from the highest point. They would tell us what God
|	wanted from us and what we can do in order to grow. They were suppose
|	to have God protect us and in the end God was nowhere to be found.

|	What do you do?

|	1. What were the dark times?
