|	The arch towers over you as if it was built in memory of a battle or
|	perhaps the liberation or victory of a great battle. Such a sight to
|	behold. I honestly am taken a back from this wonderful stone and gold
|	structure. As you walk through the arch, you stumble onto a stone path.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Travel on the path.
|	2. Attempt to climb the arch.
