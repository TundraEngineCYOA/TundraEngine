|	The statue towers over you at around twenty feet. It's of a being wearing armour
|	and a helmet. Holding a staff as if calling out to a higher power. The stone used
|	is smooth and appears to be all made from a single piece of rock. The time put into
|	it's creation must've taken some time.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Pay your respects.
|	2. Leave the room.
