|	There's two options. The first option is to leave this place, leave 
|	my home, and wander the lands for eternity...The second option...is
|	to find the Speaker, we find them and get some answers.

|	What option are you thinking of doing? You ask.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Let's go and find the speaker.
