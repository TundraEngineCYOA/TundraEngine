|	Where is the Temple? You ask, sitting eager to know.
|
|	The Temple is in the center of the city. It was where both the high
|	family and the speaker of our God ruled over all the lands. That was
|	before the dark times, before the dead roamed the now silent roads.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Tell me of the Speaker.
|	2. What were the dark times?
