|	You decide to take the first step into the unknown and slowly make your
|	way into the small stone home. There you see a small fire burning in the
|	center of the room. With worn out blankets hanging off the walls as 
|	decorations perhaps? Sitting down while facing the door is an OLD MAN,
|	who's sitting on a pillow, he appears to have been waiting for you.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Sit down by the fire.
|	2. Talk to the Old Man.
