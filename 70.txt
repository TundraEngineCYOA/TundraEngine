|	You decide to avoid the Cemetary for the time being. If what the
|	Old Man said was to be true, then it would wise not to tempt the
|	spirits at any cost. As you walk along the street in the distance
|	you see what can only be described as official buildings and just
|	Past them you see what appears to be the Temple that the Old Man
|	had mentioned before.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Go to the Temple.
|	2. Continue exploring the city.
