|	Slowly, you enter the Guard House and find it completly void of any 
|	life. Everything is left as it was before the end arrived. Food left
|	out rotting away on metal plates. A long hall dives deep into the 
|	building.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Call out for any survivors.
|	2. Walk down the hall.
