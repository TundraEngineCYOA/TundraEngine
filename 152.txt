|	Are you the Speaker? You ask, with a sense of nervousness.

|	The Speaker? Oh, no I am merely one of their humble servants. I prepare the
|	day for them and so with that I am the one many hands of God.

|	What is going on here? People are gone? The place is in ruins. What have
|	you people been doing? 

|	We have been growing as a society. We have become one with God and the
|	Speaker has given us all the glory. Where are your from? The darkness?
|	The outlands? Or perhaps you came from the outskirts?

|	
|	What do you do?

|	1. I came from the surface.
|	2. How do I get to see the Speaker?
