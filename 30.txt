|	You wander around the area until you spot in the distance an arch
|	way with a golden sun...it looks like gold. You feel yourself drawn
|	to it, but you fight the urge. Best to leave things untouched...for
|	now.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Walk through the arch.
|	2. Venture into the unknown.
