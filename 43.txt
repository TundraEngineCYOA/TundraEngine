|	I know why you've come here. I know al there is about this world and I
|	know what you seek.
|
|	What do I seek exactly? You ask.
|
|	You seek the answers within the temple, the temple holds many secrets
|	and treasures. But to obtain them, you must be willing to earn them,
|	for the price often one's own life.

|	What do you do?

|	1. What dangers await me.
|	2. Where is the Temple.
