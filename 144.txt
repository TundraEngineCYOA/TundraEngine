|	The story of creation...is a story of mystery, a story of triumph, and
|	it is a story I am glad to tell you. During the dark times when the
|	world was just forged. The Sun appeared and gave us the light, it gave
|	life where there was only darkness and cold, and soon the plants came
|	to life. The birds were created to give music and to spread the seeds
|	of life. The Sun soon made it possible for all of us to be here, for
|	our world was created to give us life, to give us the ability to create.

|	As the darkness vanished it gave us the safety from what lurkes in the
|	darkness. The Sun spoke to us and gave us a leader for who would bring
|	us into the light. The scriptures from the anicents are within these
|	walls. 

|	What do you do?

|	1. May I see them?
|	2. Tell me more.
