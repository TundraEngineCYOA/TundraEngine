|	How did God die?

|	The minute the Speaker came to our world. Once the Temple was complete
|	and those supposed loyal followers of the Speaker were choosen. It was
|	when God died did this all happen, the disease that came from a stranger,
|	the many pointless deaths, and the darkness has returned.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Can God return?
|	2. So whoever is left wants the Speaker gone?
