|	The once living world you have set foot in stand eeriely silent as
|	everything makes you think of your utter doom within this place.
|	As you lookout to the world around you in the distance you see a
|	large bird flying in the distance giving you some form of hope. 
|	Just as your about to leave you see in several dark rooms candles
|	being lit, showing some sign of life within this place.

|	1. Rest for a bit.
