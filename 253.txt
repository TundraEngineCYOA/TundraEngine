|	You kneel down and look into the crystal clear water. You can
|	feel the cold coming off of it. Leaning over you reach into the
|	water and watch as it passes by you. A few moments pass and as
|	you pull your hand out and to your horror...your hand is covered
|	in what appears to be blood.

|	What do you do?

|	2. Examine your hand.
