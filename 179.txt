|	We lived within the shadows hiding from those who were once believed
|	to be friends, family, an the like. People were becoming scared, after
|	the mere fact that God had forsaken us and soon those who survived the
|	the worst either left or decided to stay and break away from the old
|	ways. These are dark times for us and soon the light will return.

|	What do you do?

|	1. When will the light return?
