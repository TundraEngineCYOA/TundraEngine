|	Empty buildings, empty homes, void of life. Such silence would drive
|	anyone insane over a period of time. A building catches your eye, it
|	looks to be some sort of shop. Baskets are lined up infront of it as
|	a wooden sign hands from above the door. Written in a language long
|	since forgotten. The door slowly creeks open and this gives you hope
|	of maybe finding someone else in this forgotten land.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Investigate the Store.
|	2. Call out to whoever is in there.
