|	You enter another room and find yourself alone, not a corpse in sight,
|	and for that matter it appears to be a reading room. With a desk and
|	chair with books scattered about. A lite candle is all that greets you
|	dancing as it consumes oxygen.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Sit down.
|	2. Search the reading material.
