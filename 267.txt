|	What's going on here? Yu ask confused by what you see.

|	Sorry, to have scared you like that. Everyone, this is my friend
|	from the surface. A great explorer...he is trying to find the  
|	Speaker.

|	The crowd explodes with cheers and a few laughs. The Old Man turns
|	to them and calms them down.

|	This man is trying to do something that only a few have attempted
|	to do. Many have decided to do nothing but to live in this world
|	and yet he is the only one I have ever felt the sense of having
|	the ability to do it. We must all work together in finding out the
|	truth before we are all lost within the darkness for eternity.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Let's all work together?
|	2. We need a plan.
