|	You know this place is pretty alien to me. I will need some help and
|	you can show me around and if we see any Hunters we can stop them. You
|	say to her.

|	What's your point? She asks.

|	Would you like to join my Adventure?

|	I would like that, it would be nice sharing the history, and stopping
|	those who have been ruining the home of my ancestors.

|	The both of you shake hands and now you will be working together exploring
|	this unknown world. And so the both of you begin by venturing to the old
|	market.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Walk down the mainstreet.
|	2. Take the back alleys.
