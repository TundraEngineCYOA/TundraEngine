|	You enter the building and are standing in the entrance way of a
|	place completely alien to you. The walls are decorated with blankets
|	hanging on the walls. The amount of time taken to create such works
|	of amazing art. Telling the stories of their great victories in 
|	battle and how they came to be in this place. Stories of their creation
|	and how they built this city beneath the surface.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Examine the artwork.
|	2. Search the building.
