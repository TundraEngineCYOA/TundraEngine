|	I'm trying to find the Speaker.
 
|	The Speaker? Why in hell would anyone want to find the Speaker? They
|	say in a confused tone. Everyone looks to one another with looks of
|	confusion.

|	Yes, I'm trying to findout what happened here. Maybe it can be fixed
|	and whoever is left can find the answers they need.

|	No one's seen or heard from the Speaker in years. But our numbers keep
|	dropping. What should we do with the outsider everyone?

|	An eerie silence comes over the small crowd as you stand before these
|	wanderers of this forsaken place. A few of them exchange odd looks to
|	one another and suddenly the silence is broke by the appointed leader.

|	Before anything happens our leader would like to see you. He was very
|	adamant that all outsiders be brought to him. So today is your lucky
|	day. Usually, we kill those who aren't from around here...grab him.
|	Suddenly, from out of nowhere two of them make their way towards you
|	and you can feel your heart pounding. Just what will happen to you is
|	something that God knows...and he's not saying.

|	1. Attempt to run.
|	2. Attempt to fight.
|	3. Let them grab you.
