|	You stand in the fountain and are taken a back by just how life like
|	the statue is. The flower it's holding looks truly breath taking. So
|	without a second thought you attempt to take it from out her hand, but
|	you just can't reach it. If only you were a little bit taller.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Get out of the fountain.
