|	Getting on your feet, you find yourself in another world. The grass
|	green and sky is blue, a soft wind brushes past you and the warmth
|	of the sun gives you goosebumps. It's something your not use too.
|	It feels so alien to you and yet you honestly enjoy it. In the 
|	distance you see a small stream and it looks like something out of
|	a painting.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Head to the stream.
|	2. Go for a walk.
