|	How are you enjoying yourself? The Old Man says with a grin on his face.

|	You turn to see the Old Man standing before in the darkened area. He looks
|	to you and takes a step towars you with the horn in hand. 

|	Those in the Temple are not who they seem, a world forever shrouded in
|	darkness has leaders that dwell within the very pits of evil. Be warned
|	those in high places will do whatever they can to stop those who try to
|	stop from finding the truth.
