|	Slowly, you enter the alley. Not knowing just what or who you'll
|	see. But seeing not a soul your mind begins to race with who could've
|	lit the candle? Just what forces are within this dark realm of a
|	forgotten world. An eerie silence comes over the whole area as suddenly
|	a winged creature in the distance of a few buildings away leaps into
|	the air.

|	What do you do?

|	1. Follow the Stranger.
|	2. Explore the area.
