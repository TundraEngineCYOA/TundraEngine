|	Generations ago we lived in darkness...then the sky opens up and the
|	sun chased the darkness back to where it came. As the Sun arrived it
|	appointed one of the lucky to be it's Speaker. So on that day the 
|	voice of God was heard and so we built the Temple.

|	Then we moved forward and built a mighty dwellings of stone and wood
|	compared to the grass and mud that was our time of darkness. He has
|	gifted us with so much and just like a loving parent the gifts come
|	with the punishment. Too many people have turned their backs on the
|	Speaker and God. So in the end those who were struck down by the hand
|	of death got what they deserved. So those who survived were the ones
|	who believed in the light and were blessed with the gift of life.

|	What do you do?

|	1. How many are left?
|	2. May I see the Speaker?
|	3. What is your position?
